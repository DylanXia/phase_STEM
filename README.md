Dr. Yu Xia developed this open-source Python package, with the funding support by Carl Trygger Foundation, for processing and analyzing STEM (scanning transmission electron microscopy) images, with a particular focus on reconstructing phase-contrast images through DPC (differential phase contrast) images. This package also can reconstruct phase-contrast images through 4D-STEM datasets.

This project was completed at Prof. Tom Willhammarâ€™s research group at the Stockholm University.

Currently, this module has been tested using the datasets acquired by machine FEI Titan Themis S/TEM series , e.g. Z and 80-300.

The datasets with .emd format is used as the input, which is loaded by "rosettasciio" or "hyperSpy.api".

The GUI of phase_STEM has been developed using PyQt5.

The CUDA is employed to accelerate the calculation, which the cupy and numba are required.

If phase_STEM helps you in your research, please cite it (a paper is preparing).
