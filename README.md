Dr. Yu Xia created this open-source Python package for the processing and analysis of Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) images. A key feature is the reconstruction of phase-contrast images from STEM dataset. This work was conducted while Dr. Yu Xia worked in Prof. Tom Willhammarâ€™s research group at Stockholm University.

We encourage you to cite our paper, "Introducing the phase_STEM package: A Comparative Analysis of iDPC, First-Moment, and OBF Techniques", if this package proves useful in your work.

Datasets for our paper are available on Zenodo at https://zenodo.org/records/15182064

The package has been validated using datasets acquired from FEI Titan Themis S/TEM instruments, including the Z and 80-300 models. It accepts .emd format files as input, which are loaded using the "rosettasciio" library. For accelerated computation, CUDA is utilized, requiring the installation of cupy and numba.
